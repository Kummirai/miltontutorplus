# To-Do List Manager 

## Project Description:
You will build a **To-Do List Manager** program using Python lists. This program will allow users to add, remove, check, and view tasks on their to-do list. The goal is to practice core list operations such as appending, removing, checking membership, and displaying items, while building a simple interactive menu.

## Problem Statement
Your task is to create a Python script that:

- Starts with an empty to-do list.
- Allows the user to add tasks to the list.
- Allows the user to remove completed tasks.
- Checks if a task exists in the list.
- Displays the current list of tasks.
- Provides a simple menu interface for these actions.
